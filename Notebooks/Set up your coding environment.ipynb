    "1. Download and install [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/download/success) or Miniconda\n",
    "   1. You don't need to register an account.\n",
    "2. Download and install [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) \n",
    "3. Download this notebook file.\n",
    "   1. Look for the \"Download raw file\" button in the header just above the file content.\n",
    "4. Download the `environment.yml` from [this source](https://github.com/dlevine01/urban-data-analysis-course/blob/main/environment.yml)\n",
    "5. On your computer, create a new folder. Call it something like \"Urban Data Analysis\". \n",
    "   1. This can be where you store work and code for this class.\n",
    "6. Open VS Code\n",
    "   1. The following steps will all be in VS Code.\n",
    "7. Install Python and Jupyter extensions for VS Code\n",
    "   1. With VS Code open, you can browse extensions by clicking the 4-rectangle logo on the left panel.\n",
    "   2. Search for `jupyter` and install the Microsoft blue-checked \"Jupyter\" extension. \n",
    "   3. This should also install the Python and Pylance extensions.\n",
    "      1. (_if it does not_, search for and install those as well.) \n",
    "8. Open your \"Urban Data Analysis\" folder with the \"File\" > \"Open Folder...\" menu option in VS Code.\n",
    "9. Move the `Set up your coding environment.ipynb` and `environment.yml` files into that folder.\n",
    "   1. You can open the file browser tab on the left panel of VS Code and then click and drag the `environment.yml` file from your downloads folder into that file browser pane.\n",
    "   2. Or you can use your regular Finder/File Explorer windows to move the file.\n",
    "10. Open a new terminal pane with the \"Terminal\" > \"New Terminal\" menu command\n",
    "    1.  A terminal pane will open below.\n",
    "11. Copy and paste into the terminal pane: `conda env create --file environment.yml`. Hit enter.\n",
    "    1.  This will create a new conda environment with Python packages you will need for this course.\n",
    "    2.  This will take several seconds to complete. When it's finished, it will print `Executing transaction: done`.\n",
    "12. Open this notebook file in VS Code. You can click this file in the file explorer pane on the left to open it.\n",
    "13. Click \"Select Kernel\" at the top-right corner of this notebook pane. A new menu will open at the top center.\n",
    "14. Click \"Select Another Kernel...\" > \"Python Environments\" then look for your environment, `urban-data-analysis` in the list and click it.\n",
    "    1.  _If you don't see this environment in the list,_ try closing VS Code and reopening it, then repeating steps 13 and 14. Sometimes VS Code is slow to register the new environment\n",
    "    2.  _If it still does not show up_ after restarting VS Code:\n",
    "        1.  Open a new Terminal (with the \"Terminal\" > \"New Terminal\" menu command)\n",
    "        2.  Paste into the terminal below: `conda activate urban-data-analysis` and press enter.\n",
    "        3.  Then paste into the terminal below: `code .`\n",
    "        4.  This may open a new VS Code window. Look for the kernel in that window\n",
    "    3.  These extra steps should only be required the _first_ time you use this kernel. Next time you open VS Code, the kernel should already be available in the \"Select Kernel\" list.\n",
    "15. You should now see `urban-data-analysis` listed as the kernel for this notebook in the top-right corner.\n",
    "16. Run the code cells below to confirm everything is working!"
